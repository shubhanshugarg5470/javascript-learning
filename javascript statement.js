/*when we write code or do programming according to the syantax(is set  of rules
 that tell us how the code is constructed and how to write exicutable code ) of 
 the language so we basiclly give  list of   instraction   to computer  that is 
 exicuted by computer . so we call this instruction as statement .


Programming is the process of writing code according to the syntax (a set of rules
 that dictate how code should be structured) of a programming language. These rules
  ensure the code is valid and executable by the computer. Each line or block of code
   we write represents an instruction to the computer. These instructions are called 
   statements, and they are executed by the computer to perform specific tasks.
