/*and then we assign a value (wich is a datatype) 
we classify  datatype in two type (we classify datatype based on how data stored in memory and
 how we access this data)

 Primitive datatype                                            Non-primitive datatype
 -to store single value as data                            - to store collection of value
  js gives these kind of datatype                            js gives these kind of datatype in 
  number, string , null , undefined                          in form of array , object , funtion
  boolean , bigint , symbol .                                date etc.

 -during execution in stack direct                         - during execution in stack reference
  value stores.thats why these are                         or memory address of heap memory stores
  immutable.                                             where actual value stored so these are mutable.
